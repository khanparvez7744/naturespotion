                <div class="accordion-body"><p>In NMR equipment a substance is put under intense magnetic field and bombarded with radio waves of a frequency. The substance produces different frequencies of radio waves in response. The resultant set of radio wave frequencies form the signature of the substance.</p>
                <p>Quality of honey is determined primarily by enzymes found in bee stomach and hundreds of organic compounds found in nectar and pollen. A healthy bee produces more (type and quantity) enzymes and therefore more beneficial. Also healthy bees requires less chemicals to be treated for mites and bacterial infections. Some farmers resort to harsh substances like Anti-biotics, Formic acid, Sulphar etc to keep a check on diseases. These substances can sneek in (though in very small quantities). NMR tests cannot measure below certain threshold and cannot measure the quality of honey in absolute terms. They can definitely say how bad honey is but not how good the honey is. To determine the amount of nutrition in any natural product is the greatest challenge of humanity. Tests, even advanced like NMR only solves the problem of checking adulteration.</p>

                <div class="accordion-body"><p>Crystallization is common in pure honey due to glucose ,temperatue, moisture and source of the nectar .Fresh honey is a supersaturated liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures. At room temperature, honey is a supercooled liquid, in which the glucose will precipitate into solid granules. This forms a semisolid solution of precipitated glucose crystals in a solution of fructose and other ingredients.</p>
                <p>Crystallization is also affected by water content, because a high percentage of water will inhibit crystallization, as will a high dextrin content.</p>

                  <p>Honey is not only delicious, but is also beneficial. Vitamin A, B, C, Iron, Calcium and iodine are found in honey. It is also a natural source of carbohydrate, so it consumes energy, energy and energy in the body and it gives strength to the body to fight diseases.</p>
                  <p>The honey contains antiseptic, antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. Therefore it is applied to wounds, cut and burnt places and on scratches. After treating honey, the marks of the burn are also removed.</p>
                  <p>Honey is helpful in treating damaged skin. It also treats eczema, skin inflammation and other skin disorders effectively.</p>
<p>Honey plays an important role in weight loss. With this, weight can be easily reduced without any loss. It increases metabolism, which destroys excess body fat. For this, you just have to take a mixture of honey in the empty stomach lemonade in the morning and take it.</p>
<p>Honey is also good for hair. Mixing honey with olive oil and applying it in the hair will make the hair grow long, dense and soft. It also stops the problem of hair loss to a great extent.</p>
<p>Honey helps to increase hemoglobin. Regular consumption of blood is purified and anemia is also removed. It also contains antioxidant elements with vitamin B and vitamin C, which are helpful in increasing our immune system.</p>
<p>There are multiple other benefits also which honey helps us in our daily lives.</p>

                  <p>Honey is a sweet, viscous food substance made by honey bees and some related insects, such as stingless bees. Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants or from secretions of other insects, by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation.</p>
<p>With respect to carbohydrates,
  honey is mainly fructose (about 38.5%) and glucose (about 31.0%), making it similar to the synthetically produced inverted sugar syrup, which is approximately 48% fructose, 47% glucose, and 5% sucrose.
  </p>
<p>Honey's remaining carbohydrates include maltose , sucrose, and other complex carbohydrates .(www.wikipeadia.org/honey)</p>
<p>As with all nutritive sweeteners, honey is mostly sugars and contains only trace amounts of vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>Honey also contains tiny amounts of several compounds thought to function as antioxidants, including chrysin, vitamin C, and a few digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>The specific composition of any batch of honey depends on the flowers available to the bees that produced the honey.</p>

                  <p>According to the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI), heating honey is contraindicated as it causes adverse effects. Cooking it deteriorates the quality and loses its essential enzymes and nutrients. Heated honey can actually produce delirious effects in the body and can be fatal at the same time.</p>

                  <p>Water Test: In a glass of water, put a spoon of honey, if your honey is dissolving in water then it's fake. Pure honey has a thick texture that will settle at the bottom of a cup or a glass. –Vinegar Test: Mix a few drops of honey into vinegar water, if the mixture starts to foam, then your honey is fake.</p>
