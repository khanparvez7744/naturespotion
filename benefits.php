        Health Benefits</h1>
      <p align="justify" class="fs-22">Honey is known as one of nature’s greatest healer and since ancient times, honey
        has been used as both a food and a medicine. Even today, there are plenty of ways to take advantage of honey’s
        superpowers, from soothing a cough to embracing the natural sweetener’s antioxidant properties.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="fs-22">But If you still have questions about honey’s health benefits buzzing around your
        brain, read on. </p>
        <p align="justify" class="fs-22">
            We’re covering the benefits of eating honey, the conditions, concerns and health issues it can
        address and how it can act as a prime remedy when it comes to skin care.

          <h3 class="mt-0 mt-sm-5" style="font-weight: bold; color: #e69917;">Fights Harmful Agents</h3>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">Pure honey is packed with powerful antioxidants, which fights against cell
            damage, when harmful agents known as free radicals try to attack your cells, antioxidants forfeit an
            electron to keep your cells safe. Free radical damage is associated with aging, inflammatory disorders, and
            diseases, including cancer.</p>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">Luckily, honey can help combat these consequences and there’s science to back
            it up.</p>

          <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #e69917; ">Fights Harmful Bacteria</h3>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">Known for its antibacterial properties, honey has an ability to combat many
            types of bacteria, including salmonella and E. coli. Across folk medicine traditions, it’s been used as a
            treatment for a variety of bacterial and fungal infections.</p>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">During pollen synthesis, bees deposit hydrogen peroxide, a natural
            antiseptic, into the honey they’re creating. Factor in honey’s low water content and slight acidity, and the
            harmful microbes don’t stand a chance.</p>

          <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #e69917;">Calms a Sore Throat and Cough</h3>

          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">The healing property of honey for a sore throat is one of the top benefits of
            eating honey. Honey can be more effective cough suppressant for children with upper respiratory infections
            than some common cough medicines.</h5>
            </li>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">Honey is successful at suppressing coughs thanks to its antibacterial and
            anti-inflammatory powers. And, because of honey’s viscous consistency, it coats the throat providing a
            soothing effect.</h5>

          <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #e69917;">Promotes Oral Health</h3>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">Surprisingly, honey can fend off gingivitis and periodontal disease. </p>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">This might seem odd since sugary substances aren’t usually considered
            suitable for oral health. However, given honey’s natural antibacterial properties, the research suggests
            that it is more likely to fight off causes of tooth decay than cause cavities.</p>

          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">Honey is recognized as a prebiotic food, which means that it can nurture the
            good bacteria living in your gut.</p>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">It may also be a remedy for indigestion and ulcers, which is how it’s been
            used in folk medicine for years. </p>

          <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #e69917;">Keeps Blood Glucose Levels in Check</h3>
          <p class="fs-22" align="justify">Even though it’s composed of glucose and fructose, honey has a relatively low
            glycemic index and as a result, when compared to refined sugar, honey can sweeten foods without causing a
            spike in blood sugar levels. For this reason, people with Type 2 diabetes may be able to enjoy it.</p>
